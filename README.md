Basic JS exercises for Web Development

BUTTONS.html

Create a website that shows 3 users. The data is hard coded in HTML

Each user has a name, last name, and email
Next to each field there is a button that says show/hide
Click on the button and the name, last name, or email will be shown or hidden
The page looks nice because each user is in its own box/column (CSS GRID)
NOTE: When the name, last name, or email are "hidden" in reality only the text becomes a little more transparent/softer. So it is still visible, but not to strong
Only 1 element can be "hidden" at any given time for any user. Example:

If the first user has its name "hidden", then it is not possible to "hide" the last name or email until the name is "shown"
If the first user has its last name "hidden", then it is not possible to "hide" the name or email until the last name is "shown"

LOCAL_STORAGE.html

- When the user saves an item the id of the item is also stored in localStorage. The id is automatically generated (Math.random())
- Since the item is not only a name anymore, I suggest you use JSON objects for it.
{"id":12212, "name":"THE NAME YOU GIVE TO IT"}
- localStorage that has text that looks like an array with JSON objects in it
- When the objects are rendered, the id is also shown
- When the user clicks on "delete item", then item is deleted from the website and also from localStorage. You will need a loop and an if statement to compare the id of the element with the id of localStorage

AUTHENTICATE.html

Validate the form and  make sure that the given password and the confirm password are the same.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SETTIMEOUT.html
setTimeout(expression, timeout); runs the code/function once after the timeout.

SETINTERVAL.html
setInterval(expression, timeout); runs the code/function in intervals, with the length of the timeout between them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TRAFFIC_LIGHT.html

Create a traffic light using functions and setInterval/setTimeOut:
 5 sec: red, null, white
 2 sec: red, yellow, white
 5 sec: white, white, green
 2 sec: white, yellow, white

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FORM.HTML

Create a system that uses javascript objects with functions in it. For example:
 a- Create a form with name, last name, email, and passwordâ€¦
 b- there is a button to sign up.
 c- When the use clicks on that button, the data is saved in a json object that is pushed to an array
 d- the system is coded with javascript objects - functions in objects
 e- the system only uses let and const variables - NOT var
 f- the data is validated before it is pushed to the array
 g- when the data is pushed, the newly created user appears in the DOM
