BUTTONS.html

Create a website that shows 3 users. The data is hard coded in HTML

Each user has a name, last name, and email
Next to each field there is a button that says show/hide
Click on the button and the name, last name, or email will be shown or hidden
The page looks nice because each user is in its own box/column (CSS GRID)
NOTE: When the name, last name, or email are "hidden" in reality only the text becomes a little more transparent/softer. So it is still visible, but not to strong
Only 1 element can be "hidden" at any given time for any user. Example:

If the first user has its name "hidden", then it is not possible to "hide" the last name or email until the name is "shown"
If the first user has its last name "hidden", then it is not possible to "hide" the name or email until the last name is "shown"
